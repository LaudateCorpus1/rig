    "# _(DRAFT) MINIBR2050: Thunderdome_\n",
    "\n",
    "###### May 2020, [@barnabemonnot](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot)\n",
    "###### [Robust Incentives Group](https://github.com/ethereum/rig), Ethereum Foundation\n",
    "###### Built with specs v0.12\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we really care that honest, protocol-following validators, reap the highest (in-protocol) rewards. We'll get a feel for what this means here by pitting different validator behaviours against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce a bit of terminology, what we are doing here is an _agent-based model_. We do not explicitly code a scenario that agents follow, but program simple update and interaction rules, let them unfold for a while and then look at the tape to infer conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll distinguish between _strategies_ and _behaviours_. A validator can do several things: attest, propose, do neither. We'll call _strategies_ instantiations of these particular actions. For instance, a validator may employ the strategy of always attesting correctly, or flipping a coin and half the time attesting correctly, half the time not attesting at all (a pretty dumb strategy if you ask me).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the word _behaviour_ to describe the general articulation of these strategies: what to play and _when_. We explored in the [main notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/br2050.ipynb) the behaviour of the [ASAP validator](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/ASAPValidator.py), who does something as early as possible according to the specs (at the beginning of the slot for a block proposal, a third of a slot, i.e., 4 seconds in for an attestation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at a different behaviour too: the [Prudent validator](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/PrudentValidator.py). Although validators are expected to propose their block as early as possible, network delays could prevent attesters from receiving the block before a third of the slot has elapsed. ASAP validators would attest anyways, at the risk of voting on the wrong head, before receiving the block for that slot. Prudent validators hedge their bets a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If more than 4 seconds elapsed into the slot and they have received a block, they attest for that block.\n",
    "- If more than 8 seconds elapsed into the slot and they still haven't received a block, they attest for the head they know about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, prudent validators are willing to wait to see if the block will turn up, but won't wait too long either: they need to communicate their attestations in a timely manner after all!"

    "### Rewards under consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the protocol rewards attesters in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, validators receive a bonus for attesting on the correct head. Attesting too early means possibly losing out on this bonus if the head specified in the attestation is incorrect.\n",
    "- Second, validators receive a bonus for early inclusion of their attestation in a block. This means that they should attest relatively soon, and cannot wait forever to see if a missing block will turn up.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see [here in the specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#get_attestation_deltas) how rewards and penalties are computed at the end of each epoch. We focus on the `get_head_deltas`, which makes a call to `get_attestation_component_deltas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack the reward computation. A base reward is computed that depends only on the validator's effective balance and the current total active balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\texttt{BR[i]} = \\texttt{balance[i]} \\cdot \\frac{\\texttt{BRF}}{\\sqrt{\\texttt{total\\_balance}} \\cdot \\texttt{BRPE}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\texttt{BRPE}$ stands for _base rewards per epoch_. A validator can be rewarded for\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The correct source, yielding $\\texttt{BR[i]}$.\n",
    "2. The correct target, yielding $\\texttt{BR[i]}$.\n",
    "3. The correct head, yielding $\\texttt{BR[i]}$.\n",
    "4. Early inclusion, yielding at most $\\texttt{BR[i]} \\Big( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\texttt{PRQ}} \\Big)$ with $\\texttt{PRQ}$ the _proposer reward quotient_.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four items are why $\\texttt{BRPE}$ is set to 4 (at least in phase 0). $\\texttt{BRF}$, the _base reward factor_, is a scaling constant currently set at $2^6 = 64$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the first three items, we scale the base reward by the fraction of the stake who correctly attested for the item. If $\\rho_s$ is the fraction of the stake who attested correctly for the source, then a validator $i$ with a correct source receives $\\rho_s \\cdot \\texttt{BR[i]}$. However, failure to attest or attesting for an incorrect source, target or head incurs the full $\\texttt{BR[i]}$ as penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attestations may be included at least one slot after the slot they are attesting for, called the _committee slot_. If they are included in the block immediately following their committee slot, they receive the full base reward (minus the proposer reward). If they are included in the next, they receive half. Three blocks later, a third, etc. Attestations must be included at the latest one full epoch after their committee slot. The smallest inclusion reward is thus 1/32 of the base reward (assuming `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` is equal to 32)."

    "\n",
    "In a network with perfect (or close to perfect) latency and honest proposers, we don't expect ASAP and prudent validators' earnings to differ significantly. But intuitively, the behaviour of prudent validators appears more _robust_ than that of ASAP validators.\n",
    "\n",
    "When network delays are high or if we assume block proposers are lazy and don't propagate their blocks in time (or may be prudent themselves, to collect more incoming attestations), prudent validators would reap the \"correct head\" reward more often. On the other hand, when network delays are really, really high, perhaps proposing ASAP is a better strategy, to make sure that _something_ goes through, even possibly incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _\"Two nodes enter! One node leaves!\"_\n",

    "Let's pit `PrudentValidator`s against `ASAP`s with a mild network delay (on average, messages propagate one step further every 4 seconds)."
