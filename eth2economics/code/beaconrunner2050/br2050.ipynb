    "###### May 2020, [@barnabemonnot](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot)\n",
    "###### [Robust Incentives Group](https://github.com/ethereum/rig), Ethereum Foundation\n",

    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- We improve upon our second [_Beacon Runner 2049_](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb), an economics-focused simulation environment for eth2.\n",
    "- Network latencies and communications are fully represented, with each validator storing their current view of the chain or incoming blocks and attestations in a `Store` object defined in the [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store).\n",
    "- Validator behaviours are fully modular and can be plugged to the simulation as long as they follow a simple API.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand how validator behaviours map to rewards, penalties and chain outcomes. Ideally, validators who are rational are also honest, i.e., they run the eth2 protocol the way it \"should\" be run. But apart from how incentives are designed, there is no guarantee that this will indeed the case. And as we will also see, \"honesty\" may not always have a unique instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we improve upon the [first](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner/beacon_runner.ipynb) and [second](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb) Beacon Runners by introducing a more full-fledged simulation environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Previously, on..._\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first notebook, we introduced the possibility of \"wrapping\" the current specs in a [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD) simulation environment. We defined simple _strategies_ for validators that allowed them to produce blocks and attest too. The implementation was \"centralised\" in the sense that all validators shared a common view of the chain at all time -- a situation akin to being on a network with _perfect information_ and _zero latency_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural next step was to relax this assumption, and allow different views of the chain to coexist. In the simplest case, these views have an empty intersection: this is the case when the network is perfectly _partitioned_, and each side of the partition works independently. We explored there how the _inactivity leak_, which decreases the stake of inactive validators, eventually allows for finalisation to resume. But what if this intersection is not empty? In other words, what if some validators see both sides of the partition? More generally, what if each validator has their own view of the chain, governed by the messages they have received from other validators on the network?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the conditions we explore here. They are sufficient to represent an imperfect p2p network, where validators receive updates from each other after some (random) delay. We'll delve more into how the network is represented later, but you can also refer to the implementation presented in the second notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",

    "Once again, we import the specs loaded with a custom configuration file, where epochs are only 4 slots long (for demonstration purposes)."

We moved `honest_attest` and `honest_propose` to a new [validatorlib.py](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/validatorlib.py) file. This file also defines a very important class, the `BRValidator`, intended to be an abstract superclass to custom validator implementations. `BRValidator` comes packaged with a `Store`, a nifty little helper class defined in the [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store) and a bunch more logic to record past actions and current parameters.

Subclasses of `BRValidator` inherit its attributes and methods, and are themselves intended to follow a simple API. Subclasses of `BRValidator` must expose a `propose()` and an `attest()` method which return, respectively, a block or an attestation when queried (or `None` when they are shy and don't want to return anything yet). We provide an example implementation in [ASAPValidator.py](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/ASAPValidator.py) (a.k.a, _Slasho_), a very nice validator who always proposes and attests as soon as they can, and honestly too."

Our simulations are now stochastic, since the latency of the network means that some updates are random. cadCAD makes it easy to organise and run any number of instances as well as define the steps that take place in each instance.

Alternatively, refer to the [Pipfile](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/Pipfile) included here.

Though attesting too late means that the reward obtained for being included early decreases, and if you are _really_ too late, like a few epochs late, then you are not included at all. So pick your poison here. As an exercise (with more details at the end) I'll leave it to you to write a validator behaviour that attests as soon as a block is received in the slot, or no later than the end of the slot if no block comes in. It's very easy! Let's talk about it later."

    "How does the simulation proceed? We change the rules a bit here. In previous notebooks, we kept the pattern one simulation step = one slot.

    "4. **(State update)** If blocks were proposed, we disseminate them over the network.\n",
    "5. **(State update)** We call `tick` to move the clock by one step (= a second if `frequency` is 1, a tenth of a second if `frequency` is 10 etc). When `tick` moves the clock past the start of a new slot, validators update their internals, checking for instance their new attester or proposer duties if it's also a new epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever `tick` is called, we also check whether we want the network to update or not, by flipping a biased coin. By \"updating the network\", we mean that peers exchange messages at this stage. In the chain example above, with 4 validators arranged as 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3, it takes two network updates for a message from validator 3 to reach validator 0 (when 3 sends their message, we assume that it reaches all their peers instantly). The update frequency of the network is represented by the `update_rate` simulation parameter, also in Hertz. An `update_rate` of 1 means that messages spread one step further on the network each second."

    "One last thing: we discussed before the use of a cadCAD fork that doesn't record a complete copy of the simulation state at each step. This is critical because when we set a very high `frequency`, during many steps nothing really happens: no one is proposing or attesting, but we still should ping validators to check if they want to do either. Recording the full state every step is quite wasteful! So instead, we'll define [_observers_](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/observers/observed-br2049.ipynb), or _metrics_, functions of the state that record a simple value at each step, such as the average balance of validators or the current slot.

Each validator maintains their own current state, which is made up of all the blocks and attestations they have seen until now. It's not necessarily the case that all validators agree on the current balances of everyone! In the extreme case of a partition, which we discussed in the [previous notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb), the two sides of the partition had completely different accounts of the current distribution.\n",

    "Well, there is no one single correct answer. If we believe our network is fully connected (i.e., no partition), given that all validators eventually receive any message, we could just sample the distribution of any one validator and we'll have some guarantee that it's not too far off from the distribution of any other's (unless the latency is real, real bad). We could \"average the average\" over all validators' states, that would work too. But let's keep it simple and just get a sample."
