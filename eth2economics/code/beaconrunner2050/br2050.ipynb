    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- We improve upon our second [_Beacon Runner 2049_](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb), an economics-focused simulation environment for eth2.\n",
    "- Network latencies and communications are fully represented, with each validator storing their current view of the chain or incoming blocks and attestations in a `Store` object, as defined in the [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store).\n",
    "- Validator behaviours are fully modular and can be plugged to the simulation as long as they follow a simple API, to produce rich agent-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand how validator behaviours map to rewards, penalties and chain outcomes. Ideally, validators who are rational are also honest, i.e., they run the eth2 protocol the way it \"should\" be run. But apart from how incentives are designed, there is no guarantee that this will indeed the case. And as we will also see, \"honesty\" may not always have a unique instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we improve upon the [first](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner/beacon_runner.ipynb) and [second](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb) Beacon Runners by introducing a more full-fledged simulation environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Previously, on..._\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [first notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner/beacon_runner.ipynb), we introduced the possibility of \"wrapping\" the current specs in a [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD) simulation environment. We defined simple _strategies_ for validators that allowed them to produce blocks and attest too. The implementation was \"centralised\" in the sense that all validators shared a common view of the chain at all time -- a situation akin to being on a network with _perfect information_ and _zero latency_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural next step was to relax this assumption, and allow different views of the chain to coexist. In the simplest case, these views have an empty intersection: this is the case when the network is perfectly _partitioned_, and each side of the partition works independently. [We explored in the second notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb) how the _inactivity leak_, which decreases the stake of inactive validators, eventually allows for finalisation to resume. But what if this intersection is not empty? In other words, what if some validators see both sides of the partition? More generally, what if each validator has their own view of the chain, governed by the messages they have received from other validators on the network?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the conditions we explore here. They are sufficient to represent a realistic p2p network, where validators receive updates from each other after some (random) delay. We'll reuse the network model introduced in the previous notebook, reintroduced in the next section with a brief introduction to the validator API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "[Once again](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb), we import the specs loaded with a custom configuration file, `fast`, where epochs are only 4 slots long (for demonstration purposes)."

We moved `honest_attest` and `honest_propose` to a new [validatorlib.py](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/validatorlib.py) file. This file also defines a very important class, the `BRValidator`, intended to be an abstract superclass to custom validator implementations. `BRValidator` comes packaged with a `Store`, a nifty little helper class defined in the [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store) and a bunch more logic to record past actions and current parameters. We'll get to them in a short while. \n",

Subclasses of `BRValidator` inherit its attributes and methods, and are themselves intended to follow a simple API. Subclasses of `BRValidator` must expose a `propose()` and an `attest()` method which return, respectively, a block or an attestation when queried (or `None` when they are shy and don't want to return anything yet). We provide an example implementation in [ASAPValidator.py](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/ASAPValidator.py) (a.k.a, _Slasho_), a very nice validator who always proposes and attests as soon as they can, and honestly too."

    "Let's talk about cadCAD once more. Our simulations are now stochastic, since the latency of the network means that some updates are random. cadCAD makes it easy to organise and run any number of instances as well as define the steps that take place in each instance.

With advice from [the cadCAD community](https://community.cadcad.org/t/mitigating-cadcad-overhead/140), and a nice \"tweak\" by [Danilo Lessa](https://twitter.com/danilolessa) to the source, the simulations are implemented following the pattern described [in this notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/observers/observed-br2049.ipynb).\n",

Alternatively, refer to the [Pipfile](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/Pipfile) included here.

    "- We have a group of validators who are all individually keeping track of their view of the beacon state.\n",
    "- Validators are on a network and communicate with each other, keeping track of known (but perhaps unincluded) attestations and blocks.\n",
    "- Whenever something changes, e.g., the beginning of a new slot/epoch or a new block/attestation received on-the-wire (as in, from the p2p network), validators update their internals to parameterise their strategies.\n",
    "- Each step, the simulation pings all validators and asks whether they want to propose or attest at this point in time. Depending on their internals, validators reply with a block or an attestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this nice playground for validators to roam around, we are getting close to a full-fledged _agent-based model_. But we need more agents! Who expects here that all validators will be ASAP always? And is ASAP the only \"good\" behaviour? Probably not!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the framework developed in this notebook to explore these questions, with a series of smaller \"case studies\" looking at specific questions. Note that our simulation environment is still incomplete, in that validators should do more than just proposing and attesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up until now we assumed proposers were taking on the responsibility of aggregating their known attestations to record them in their proposed blocks. In eth2, aggregators are separate entities, chosen randomly at each slot.\n",
    "- We also haven't given our validators the power to slash malicious validators. With a few tweaks here and there we can do that simply enough."
